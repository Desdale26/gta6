/*
 * data/story-act3m21.js — m21 TWO-TEN, Act 3 of "Ten and Two".
 *
 * The Tally exchange at the Pier 9 transfer yard, 02:10 on the thirtieth,
 * three years to the minute. Horne and Rourke come instead of Voss. Horne
 * taps his watch at 02:11:04, the second Tommy died, and a Halberd rifle on
 * Stavros's orange crane puts Augie down in bay 14. At 02:11:20, the second
 * he put it in gear three years ago, Jay opens the car door instead and goes
 * back across the lot. Augie dies in the back of Nana Lu's car on the way to
 * Mercy General with Mae's hands on his chest. Rourke takes the Tally.
 *
 * Flags set: augie_dead. Flags read: saved_teo / chased_rourke,
 * trusted_calder / refused_calder, mae_stay / mae_space, kept_cut / gave_cut.
 *
 * Continuity: Dex gave Horne the time, the bay, the car and Rhea's rifle
 * positions (m22), then sat in the second car at the garage with the engine
 * running until four. It is a Sunday morning, so Del won't play "Porchlight"
 * (that's Tuesdays: m22's coda). Jay has read up to letter eight.
 *
 * Invented here that later acts may lean on: Augie's watch is Celia's, a
 * steel thing on a cracked strap that has never lost a second (with
 * saved_teo he gives it to Teo in the car; with chased_rourke he gives it to
 * Jay to pass on); Birdie's crayon horse, MR AUGIE AT WORK, was in his shirt
 * pocket; Horne's cruiser 1-ADAM-9 was parked in bay 13; Kostya was found
 * zip-tied in the orange crane's cab, alive and furious; Voss's card read
 * "OLD MARKET STANDS. YOU HAVE MY WORD. H.V."; Augie knew Voss's father, Big
 * Harlan (diesel and oranges), and little Harlan used to steal his bike;
 * letter thirty-seven is "the good one", to be read last.
 *
 * Engine notes: the crew are pre-spawned at the bar so a checkpoint retry
 * rebuilds them far from the docks. The wounded Augie in bay 14 replaces the
 * standing one under a blackout, and is hidden by moving Jay well away under
 * another; on the drive Augie rides as dialogue, not as an actor, so nobody
 * climbs out of the back seat at the hospital. A short `say` step comes
 * before every scene or blackout that follows car banter, so no line is cut.
