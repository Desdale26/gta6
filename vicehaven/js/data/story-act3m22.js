/*
 * data/story-act3m22.js — m22 LUGNUT, Act 3 of "Ten and Two".
 *
 * Two nights after Pier 9. The payments lead to Calloway Auto. Jay tails
 * Dex to the top deck of the Grand Parkade (Noor's canary spot, the one
 * nobody visited), hears Horne pay him off, and lays the seeds back down in
 * front of him one at a time, the way Augie laid out napkins. Halberd comes
 * up the ramp to tidy Horne's informant away. In the lull Jay finally says
 * what he means, and then decides what Dex is: forgiven, banished, or a
 * witness. Every branch ends the same way: one in the morning, a Tuesday,
 * and a reminder Augie set on Jay's phone in m19.
 *
 * Flags set: dex_forgiven / dex_banished / dex_to_calder.
 * Flags read: trusted_calder / refused_calder.
 *
 * Invented here that later acts may lean on: Birdie's school is St. Brigid's
 * Primary (yellow gate on Anchor Street, lollipop lady called Pat), and
 * Horne gave a talk there in the spring and got a card with a horse on it;
 * Horne's first envelope was $4,000 and went down on the lift; Dex's
 * catalytic converter was wrapped in Birdie's octopus beach towel; with
 * dex_forgiven Ansel spends the night in the garage doorway with a chair
 * (so he is there for Birdie when it burns in m23), and Birdie has a
 * spelling test on Thursday (necessary, rhythm, separate); with
 * dex_banished Rafi has the garage keys and Dex has told Birdie they are
 * going "somewhere with snow" on holiday; with dex_to_calder Mae and Gus
 * collect Birdie in Medic 12, and Calder rings Ray Okonkwo (trusted only).
 *
 * Engine notes: every branch gets Jay back into Lulu before the coda, so the
 * radio call is always made from behind the wheel. A short `say` step comes
 * before every scene or phone call that follows car banter, so no line is
 * cut. The cleaners are cocky (low accuracy, one group holding by its car)
 * because they came for one unarmed mechanic; Jay takes a vest in the lull.
