/*
 * data/story-act3sf.js — side chain 2, THE SILVER FOXES (sf1 to sf4), for
 * "Ten and Two". Giver: Lefty Marchetti. Unlocks after m06_tick_tock.
 *
 * Three robbers with a combined age of two hundred and twenty-four want one
 * last job: to rob Pelican's "Golden Years Equity" scheme, which has been
 * bleeding their retirement home dry in cash, one envelope at a time. It is
 * the comedy chain. It is also, quietly, about memory, because Walt's is
 * going, and in his head it is 1981 and Jay is Frankie, their old driver.
 *
 * Sets: foxes_done (sf4). Local flags: sf_frankie / sf_truth (sf3).
 * Reads: otis_free / otis_taken (bounty 8, story-extras.js).
 *
 * Invented here that later acts lean on (and that the act 4 files already
 * assume): Frankie drove for the Foxes for six years and in 1983, on the
 * Pembroke job, drove off with the money and left Walt on the kerb. Walt did
 * five years; Ruthie waited all five; Walt never said Frankie's name again
 * until his memory went. "Fox rules": nobody gets hurt and everybody gets
 * home. Lefty wants the mint car back on Sundays (Ending B). Marvin Teague
 * gets his 1979 hat back. The window booth at the Starlite was Walt and
 * Ruthie's before it was Jay and Mae's: there's a W+R under the J+M.
